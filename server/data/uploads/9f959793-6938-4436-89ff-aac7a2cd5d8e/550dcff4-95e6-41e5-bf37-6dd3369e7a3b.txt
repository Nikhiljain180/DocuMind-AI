Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning

Artificial intelligence (AI) is the simulation of human intelligence by machines. Machine learning is a subset of AI that enables systems to learn and improve from experience.

Key concepts:
- Neural Networks: Inspired by biological neurons
- Deep Learning: Multi-layered neural networks
- Natural Language Processing: Understanding human language
- Computer Vision: Interpreting visual information

Applications include autonomous vehicles, medical diagnosis, and recommendation systems.
