### What was built:

#### Security & Authentication
- ✅ Password hashing with bcrypt
- ✅ JWT token generation and validation
- ✅ Token expiration management
- ✅ Security utilities module

#### Authentication Service
- ✅ User signup with validation
- ✅ Email/username uniqueness checks
- ✅ User signin with password verification
- ✅ JWT token creation on successful auth
- ✅ Current user extraction from token

#### API Routes
- ✅ POST `/api/auth/signup` - Register new user
- ✅ POST `/api/auth/signin` - Login user
- ✅ POST `/api/auth/logout` - Logout (client discards token)
- ✅ GET `/api/auth/me` - Get current user info (protected)

#### Protected Routes
- ✅ HTTPBearer authentication dependency
- ✅ `get_current_user_id` dependency for route protection
- ✅ Token extraction and validation

```

### How to Test:

1. **Start Docker services**:
   ```bash
   docker-compose up postgres qdrant redis
   ```

2. **Run migrations**:
   ```bash
   cd server
   uv venv && source .venv/bin/activate
   uv pip install -r requirements.txt
   alembic revision --autogenerate -m "Initial migration"
   alembic upgrade head
   ```

3. **Start server**:
   ```bash
   uvicorn app.main:app --reload
   ```

4. **Test in browser**:
   - Visit: http://localhost:8000/docs
   - Try POST `/api/auth/signup` with:
     ```json
     {
       "email": "test@example.com",
       "username": "testuser",
       "password": "password123"
     }
     ```
   - Copy the `access_token` from response
   - Click "Authorize" button, paste token
   - Try GET `/api/auth/me` (should return user info)

### API Endpoints:

#### Public Endpoints (No Auth Required):
- `POST /api/auth/signup` - Create new user account
- `POST /api/auth/signin` - Login and get token
- `POST /api/auth/logout` - Logout instruction

#### Protected Endpoints (Token Required):
- `GET /api/auth/me` - Get current user information
